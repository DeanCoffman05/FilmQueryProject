# Lessons Learned
SQL is a simple but powerful to to access large amounts of data in an effienct way. Continuosly running this level of code certainly has an effect on the OS. I was able to overcome many issues with adding SQL queries in the correct way. In this project I was able to pull from as many as four different columns to solve issues I wouldn not have been able to before. This is a great learning experience.
